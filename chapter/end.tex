\chapter{Conclusion}

As a matter of fact, every piece of written academic work is subject
to the individual criteria of their authors, characterizing their personal 
style of presenting facts. This style is not necessarily identical with the 
reader's personal concept of presentation; hence, it is most likely that some 
aspects of this guideline are based on our subjective idea of what 
characterizes a good composition. 

The majority of points mentioned in this guideline, however, reflect the 
practical values that have proven useful to us when presenting our own 
scientific texts. Therefore it is worthwhile keeping this guideline in the 
back of your mind when composing your scientific work in order to avoid the 
grossest mistakes from the very beginning.
